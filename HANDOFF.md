> **All three files (index.html, style/main.css, style/main.js) plus the images/ folder must be in the same place for the site to work. Never move one without the others.**

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this entire folder to a GitHub repository (everything in it, including `images/`)
2. In Vercel, connect the repo. No build settings needed — it's a static site.
3. Vercel will serve `index.html` automatically from the root.
4. Every push to your main branch auto-deploys. That's it.

**Critical:** Vercel's servers are Linux and **filenames are case-sensitive**. `ben-lunge-event.png` and `Ben-Lunge-Event.png` are different files. The filenames in `index.html` and `main.css` must match the actual files in `images/` exactly.

## The One Thing to Do Before Launch: Wire the Forms

Both email capture forms (the orange strip under the hero, and the final CTA section) are fully built and ready. They just need a backend endpoint.

Search `index.html` for `YOUR_FORM_ENDPOINT_HERE` — it appears in both forms.

**Quickest option — Formspree (free, no code):**
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a free account
2. Create a new form, copy your endpoint URL (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/abcdefgh`)
3. Replace both instances of `YOUR_FORM_ENDPOINT_HERE` with that URL
4. Formspree emails you every signup and has a dashboard to export them

**Other options:**
- **Mailchimp:** Use their embedded form action URL, add `name="EMAIL"` to the email input (already has `name="email"` — Mailchimp needs uppercase, just change the attribute)
- **ConvertKit:** Same approach — their form POST URL goes in the `action` attribute
- **Your own backend:** The forms POST `email` and `_subject` fields. Add whatever fields you need.

Once the endpoint is live, test it by submitting a real email and confirming you receive it.

## Launch Day: Flipping All Buttons

Every "JOIN WAITLIST" button on the page will become "START NOW" or "APPLY NOW" in one edit.

Open `style/main.js`. At the very top, find:

```javascript
const LAUNCH_MODE = false;
```

Change `false` to `true`. Save. Push to GitHub. Done.

Every button on the page — nav, hero, orange strip, all 7 programme cards, final CTA — updates automatically. Each button already has its launch-day label stored in a `data-launch-text` attribute in the HTML.

To go back to waitlist mode, set it to `false` again.

---

## Common Edits

### Change a price
Open `index.html`. Find the programme by name (Base, Build, Strong, Capacity, Prime, Pro, Custom). Edit the `<div class="card-price">` block. Example:
```html
<div class="card-price">$149<span class="price-week">/mo · $35/wk</span></div>
```

### Change programme descriptions
Same location — the `<div class="card-detail">` inside each programme card.

### Update the "100 spots" number as your waitlist fills
Search `index.html` for `spots-count`. Every instance of the number is wrapped in `<span class="spots-count">100</span>` — update the number in each place, or remove the scarcity language entirely once the waitlist is closed.

### Add a testimonial
In `index.html`, find section 09 (search `FIELD REPORTS`). Copy one `<div class="quote">` block, paste it after the last one, update the photo src, name, journey line, and quote text. Add the client's photo to `images/` first.

### Change the hero photo
In `style/main.css`, find `.hero-visual` and update the `url('../images/...')` part of `background-image`. Keep the `linear-gradient(...)` in front of it — that's the orange overlay treatment.

### Change the coach photo
In `style/main.css`, find `.ben-photo` and update its `url('../images/...')` the same way.

### Change brand colours
Open `style/main.css`. At the very top, find `:root { ... }`. All colours are defined here:
```css
:root {
  --black:  #111111;
  --cream:  #F9F6F2;
  --white:  #FFFFFF;
  --orange: #FF8210;
}
```
Change a value here and it updates everywhere on the site instantly.

## Design System: Rules to Follow When Editing

These were deliberate decisions — breaking them will make the site look inconsistent.

**Colours:** Only ever use the four CSS variables above. Never hardcode a hex value anywhere.

**Fonts:** Three fonts, each with a specific job:
- `Inter` — all body text and headings
- `IBM Plex Mono` — labels, tags, prices, button text, anything monospaced
- `Fraunces italic` — pull quotes and testimonial blockquotes only

**Buttons:** All buttons have `border-radius: 6px`. If you add a new button, use one of the two existing classes:
- `.bracket-btn` — solid orange, black text. Primary CTAs.
- `.ghost-btn` — transparent, thin border. Secondary CTAs on light backgrounds.

**Sections alternate backgrounds** in this order: black → orange → cream → black → cream → orange → cream → black → cream → black → footer. Breaking that rhythm makes the page feel unbalanced.

**Orange accent:** Used for: brand colour, active state, price highlights, eyebrow labels, the orange gradient on photos. Not used for: body text, backgrounds (except the strip sections). Don't add more orange — the current balance is deliberate.

## How the Scroll Animations Work

Every element with `class="reveal"` starts invisible and fades up when it enters the viewport. This is handled by `main.js` using an `IntersectionObserver` — no library needed.

To make something animate in on scroll, add `class="reveal"` to it.  
To stagger a group of items, wrap them in `class="reveal-group"` and add `style="--i:0"`, `--i:1"`, `--i:2"` etc. to each child.

The three stat numbers (17 years / 3 countries / 1000+ clients) count up from 0 when they scroll into view. To change a stat's final value, change `data-target="N"`. The `data-suffix="+"` attribute appends a symbol after the number finishes counting.

## Sections Reference

| 01 | Nav bar | Black | Sticky. Logo + links + CTA. |

| 06 | Programme table | Cream | Two-row card grid. 7 programmes. Pro is the funnel target. |
| 07 | Guarantee | Orange | "It's coached" trust statement. |
| 08 | Coach Ben | Cream | Bio, stats, Ben's competition photo. |
| 09 | Testimonials | Black | Three real clients with photos. |
| 10 | Pull quote | Cream | Ben's founder quote. |
| 11 | Final CTA | Black | Second email form. Same endpoint as section 03. |
| — | Footer | Black | Logo + copyright. |

## Things Not Yet Built (Open Items)

- **Form backend** — see "Wire the Forms" above. The forms are ready; they just need an endpoint.
- **Live spots counter** — the "100 spots" number is currently static, updated manually. A live counter requires the form backend to be in place first so you know the real count.
- **Thank-you page / redirect** — after someone submits the waitlist form, they currently see the browser's default behaviour. Add a `_next` hidden input pointing to a thank-you URL once your form service is set up.
- **Programmes comparison page** — built separately, not yet linked from this page.

## For the LLM Helping with Future Edits

This site uses a deliberate, well-documented structure. Before making any change:

1. **Read the CSS comment above the rule you're changing.** Every section of `main.css` has a comment block explaining what it controls and what to watch out for.
2. **Read the HTML comment above the section you're changing.** Same — every section in `index.html` is documented.
3. **Never add inline styles except for `--i:N` stagger variables.** All styling belongs in `main.css`.
4. **Never add a `<style>` block inside `index.html`.** The CSS is fully external.
5. **Image paths in CSS use `../images/`** (one level up from `style/`). Image paths in HTML use `images/` (relative to root).
6. **The launch-day button swap is in `main.js` — `const LAUNCH_MODE = false`.** Changing this to `true` flips every CTA on the page. Don't modify individual button text manually.
7. **The programme table is a 5-column CSS grid.** Row 1 spans are 1+1+1+1+1=5. Row 2: Pro spans 3, Custom spans 2. If you add a card, keep the row totals at 5 or adjust `grid-template-columns` accordingly.
8. **Both email forms POST to the same endpoint.** If you update one `action`, update the other.
